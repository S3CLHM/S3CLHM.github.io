					<h3>Hong Kong</h3>
					<p>From all the data collected, it is shown that the majority regards that they have a satisfactory level of worklife balance, with adequate amount of quality relaxing time as well as working time. In our survey, 31 respondents are from Hong Kong with 67.7% are students.Near a quarter (25.8%) of the respondents spend 3 to 4 hours in working or studying per day while another quarter spend around 9 to 10 hours in working or studying. Near half of the respondents (51.6%) spend 3 to 4 hours on their own leisure time on average per day. None of them can spend 11 hours or above in leisure time.  This reflects that Hong Kong people are very busy. 67.7% of the respondents opined that they have enough rest/leisure time on average. These are those who rated 3 to 5 in the question. 64.6% of the respondents think they have good work life balance. This is based on those who rated 3 to 5 in the question. Main elements contain in "fulfilling life" comprise: "Happy, achieving goals, meaningful life, sufficient rest and enough food to fulfill basic needs and other necessities. To have own time to play or leisure are important too. 61.3% of the respondents think that Hong Kong government facilitates good work life balance (those who rated 3 to 4) and none of them rated 5. Suggestion to improve work life balance include less work, setting legislation to regulate the working hours or allow flexible working hour. Some of them commented that to have a better time management each day by good planning of work is essential too. In conclusion, we hope that the government can lay down legislations to promote work life balance so that Hongkongers can have a better life and live happier and healthier with their families.</p>

					<h3>Singapore</h3>
					<p>According to the data we have, we figured out that most of our interviewees (28.1%) work around 7 to 8 hours per day. However, when we look at the chart, we found out Singapore citizens’ working hour is quite diverse. In another question, we have asked the interviewees how long do they spend their time to relax, and we have found that half of the interviewees spend 3 to 4 hours to rest and relax. We have asked our interviewees to rate whether they have enough rest. Most of the interviewees (34.4%) think they don’t have enough rest and leisure time. We have also asked them to rate whether they have a good life balance. 37.5% of the interviewees felt neutral about it. Last but not least, We asked the interviewees to rate from 1 to 5 on how the Singaporean government do on facilitating good work-life balance. 43.8% of the interviewees felt neutral about it, while 31.2% of the interviewees thought that the Singaporean government could have done more work. To conclude, many of the Singapore citizens believed that they don’t have enough rest and the Singaporean government could have done more work to improve their work-life balance. </p>
